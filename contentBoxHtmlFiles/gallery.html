        <p class="textcolor longtext">Reptile island is a family owned website that we are looking to sell. It was originally owned by my father and hosted on netsol.
            I have taken over the coding for the website and have decided to code everything by hand and host it on my own in hopes that
            we can sell not only the domain but a fully fleshed out ecommerce website along with it. Reptile island sells specialty
            pet products currently off ebay. The website itself has a full backend with a user account system and a cart.
